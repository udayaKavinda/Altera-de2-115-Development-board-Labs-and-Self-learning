# CO503 Advanced Embedded Systems Labs

Welcome to the **CO503 Advanced Embedded Systems Labs** repository! In this repository, we explore various aspects of embedded systems using the Altera DE2-115 FPGA. Below, you'll find information about each lab and the overall folder structure.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: System-on-Chip (SoC) Design
- **Description**: In this lab, we delve into the fundamentals of SoC design. We'll explore how to integrate different components (such as processors, memory, and peripherals) into a single system.
- **Folder**: `/Lab01`
- **Contents**:
    - **Part 1: First SoC - LED Counter**
      - Develop a basic SoC to control an LED counter on the FPGA.
    - **Part 2: JPEG Encoder**
      - Implement a JPEG Encoder within the SoC, utilizing SDRAM for image processing.
    - `README.md`: Detailed instructions and explanations for Lab 1.


### Lab 2: Processor Customizations
- **Description**: In Lab 2, we'll focus on customizing processors. This may involve modifying existing processor architectures or creating custom instructions.
- **Folder**: `/Lab2_Processor_Customizations`
- **Contents**:
    - Placeholder for future content.

### Practical 3: MPSoC Design
- **Description**: Practical 3 will cover Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) design. We'll explore parallel processing, communication between processors, and optimizing performance.
- **Folder**: `/Practical3_MPSoC_Design`
- **Contents**:
    - Placeholder for future content.

### Practical 4: JPEG MPSoC Design Project
- **Description**: In Practical 4, we'll tackle a specific project related to JPEG image processing using MPSoC techniques.
- **Folder**: `/Practical4_JPEG_MPSoC_Project`
- **Contents**:
    - Placeholder for future content.
